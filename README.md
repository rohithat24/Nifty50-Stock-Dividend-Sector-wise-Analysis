Sector-wise Dividend Analysis of Nifty 50 Data
This project aims to perform sector-wise dividend analysis for the Nifty 50 index using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The objective is to collect stock data for each company at dividend announcement and ex-dividend dates, analyze the stock price changes, and visualize the data using line plots, scatter plots, risk-to-reward plots, and box plots. By extracting insights from the data, investors can make informed decisions.
